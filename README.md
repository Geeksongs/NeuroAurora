# NeuroAurora
**NeuroAurora**: A Dataset for Proactive Multimodal Agents with Long-Term Memory. This is the world's first multimodal dataset featuring exocentric videos for evaluating long-term memory in Proactive AI.  

## 🧠 Neuro-Enabled Proactive AI Dataset

🔥🔥🔥We introduce the **first multimodal dataset with exocentric video recordings** specifically designed to support **Proactive AI agents**.  
Unlike existing datasets, ours captures not only **visual and temporal cues** but also **rich behavioral anomalies** across four key dimensions:

---

## 📊 Key Dimensions

### 1. **Task Omission**
- Identifying missing steps
- Skipped subtasks
- Unfinished goals  
📌 _Example_: “You haven’t turned on the stove. Would you like help?”

### 2. **Repetition Anomalies**
- Repeated failures
- Long pauses
- Inconsistent actions  
📌 _Example_: “You’ve tried to open the door several times. Should I check the lock?”

### 3. **Intent Deviations**
- Wrong object usage
- Confused explorations  
📌 _Example_: “That’s dish soap, not oil. Do you want me to find the right item?”

### 4. **Temporal Awareness**
- Schedule-based deviations
- Time-sensitive interventions  
📌 _Example_: “You’re getting ready to leave, but your ID is still on the table.”

## 🚀 What Makes This Dataset Unique?

This dataset enables AI agents to go beyond **passive perception** and engage in:

- ✅ Self-evolution  
- ✅ Proactive behavior  
- ✅ Adaptive intervention  

It supports capabilities such as:

- 🔁 Self-correction  
- 🧭 Intention inference  
- ⏰ Real-time decision making  
- 🧠 Long-term memory modeling
